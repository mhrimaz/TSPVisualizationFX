# TSPVisualizationFX
Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm and JavaFX.</br>

# How to run
By clicking on screen you will create new City(Circle) and by hitting space the algorithm will start to wok and show you the solution</br>
To make the solution better you just need to hit space again

- Space: Run the PSO Algorithm
- Ctrl+Space: Run the Genetic Algorithm
