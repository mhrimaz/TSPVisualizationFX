Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm and JavaFX Visualization</br>
There is a small difference in the solution from original TSP problem.</br>
The represented solution is not a closed path so it's slightly easear than original TSP problem,
however solving original problem is possible with this algorithm
# How to run
By clicking on screen you will create new City(Circle) and by hitting space the algorithm will start to wok and show you the solution</br>
To make the solution better you just need to hit space again
